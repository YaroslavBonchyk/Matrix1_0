# Matrix1_0
The console app “Matrix 1.0” is a project that implements basic concepts in SLE (Systems of Linear Equations), QR decomposition, and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). A naive approach was primarily used in this version of the project, without relying on specialized C++ libraries such as BLAS/LAPACK, Armadillo, Eigen, or similar ones.
